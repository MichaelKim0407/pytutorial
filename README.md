    Enter a chapter.

    Turn pages.
    
    You can use `,` & `.` for short.

    Exit the tutorial, if you are really sure :)
    
    `q` for short.

* More useful commands

1. back & forward

    Suppose that you want to go back to a page you previously was viewing after opening the help menu, but you don't remember in which chapter it was. Simply type `back` and you are there.
    
    `<` and `>` for short.

4. refresh

    Just provide two values: the chapter number and the item number.

* All commands can be found in `help -A`
